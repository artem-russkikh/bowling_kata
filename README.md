# The Bowling Game Kata in Ruby

## Introduction

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their
skills through practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by
Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the
Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.
As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published 21 different katas.

## About bowling

The game consists of 10 frames. In each frame the player has
two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The score for the frame is the total
number of pins knocked down, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.

A spare is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two tries. The bonus for
that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.

A strike is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first try. The bonus
for that frame is the value of the next two balls rolled.

In the tenth frame a player who rolls a spare or strike is allowed to roll the extra
balls to complete the frame. However no more than three balls can be rolled in
tenth frame.
